# .emacs
My personal .emacs file for Rust development. It contains the Mozillas rust-mode .emacs file because I am too lazy setting things up every time and I only want to copy one file. Originally taken from Casey Muratorys .emacs file, cleaned up plus functions. Should work "out of the box" (it currently doesn't work). 

It opens two buffers, left and right.
